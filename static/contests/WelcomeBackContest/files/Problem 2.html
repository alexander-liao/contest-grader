  Joe manages an apartment in KW. Being a businessman, heâ€™d like to get the most amount of people in his hotel, so he can make a lot of money! Unfortunately, some of the customers have special requests. Each customer has a room size request, the size of the room (from 1 to S inclusive) that they want in the hotel. Joe would like to keep them all happy, so giving a customer a room bigger than they asked for is fine. However, Joe cannot give them a smaller room, so at some point he might run out of rooms. Tell Joe how many people he can service.
