  Your brother George is struggling with Math again. He is learning about medians, modes and averages. On a bonus problem on his homework, he is given a grid of numbers, and asked to calculate the <b>median of the medians</b>, the <b>mode of the modes</b>, and the <b>average of the averages</b>.
</p><br />
<p>
  <h3>Input Specifications</h3>
  The first line will contain N (N < 250, N will be odd).<br />
  The next N lines will contain N integers each, space-separated.
</p><br />
  <h3>Output Specifications</h3>
  The output will contain 3 integers on one line, the median of the medians, the mode of the modes, and the average of the averages. <br />
  The median is the middle number of a sequence when sorted in increasing order.<br />
  The mode is the most common element of a sequence, with ties broken by whichever element is larger.<br />
  The average is the sum of the numbers in the sequence divided by the length of the sequence.<br />
  Round the final average to 2 decimal places. If the final average is precise to fewer than 2 digits, pad on extra zeroes so that the final output has a decimal point followed by exactly two digits.
</p><br />
<p>
  <h3>Subtasks</h3>
  For 20% of the available 100 marks, N < 10.<br />
  For an additional 20% of the available 100 marks, N < 100.
</p><br />
<p>
  <h3>Sample Input</h3>
  <table><tr><td>3<br />1 2 2<br />4 3 4<br />7 5 6</td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>
  <h3>Sample Output</h3>
  <table><tr><td>4 7 3.78</td></tr></table>
