  In your city, there are N intersections, labeled 1 to N, with N-1 bidirectional roads between them, forming a totally connected city with no loops. You are currently at point A, and your friend, Bob, is at point B. You would like to travel from point A to point B as quick as possible, to meet your friend on time! Each road takes 1 minute to travel along. How long will it take you to get to your friend?
